# Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Multiclass
Neural network to recognize ten handwritten digits, 0-9. This is a multiclass classification task where one of the n choices is selected. Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.
MNIST handwritten digit dataset is used
